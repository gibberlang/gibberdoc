## Questions to debate:
-- Should this be a transpiled that compiles to an existing language like Rust, Go, or TypeScript ? OR A completely new language with its own runtime ? OR Both?
-- Should this lanaguage use a community specification request model used by Java development? https://jcp.org/ja/jsr/overview.
-- What build tools should it use? Could the build language be used by LLMs to understand dependencies and provide better responses?
-- how to acheive optimal token usage?
