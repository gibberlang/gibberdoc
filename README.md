# Gibber: An AI-Optimized Programming Language

## 🚀 Introduction

Gibber is a new programming language designed **specifically for AI-assisted coding**. Unlike traditional languages optimized for human developers, Gibber is built to enhance **Large Language Model (LLM) code generation**—making it more **accurate, efficient, and bug-free**.

### Why Gibber?

LLMs like Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude and others generate code in existing languages but often:

- Produce **suboptimal** or **redundant** code.
- Struggle with **implicit logic and ambiguous syntax**.
- Require **manual debugging and testing**.

Gibber solves this by providing:

- **LLM-Friendly Syntax**: Highly structured, predictable, and constrained.
- **Enforced Testing**: Code must include tests, which are executed at compile time.
- **Strong Typing + Type Inference**: Reduces ambiguity while keeping code concise.
- **Generics & Collections**: Built-in support for common data structures.
- **Multi-Platform Compilation**: Like Rust, write once and compile anywhere.

## 🛠 Core Features

### ✅ **Strict Yet Understandable Syntax**

Gibber enforces **clear, unambiguous syntax** to prevent AI misinterpretations while remaining readable to humans.

```gibber
@purpose("Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer")
@requires(n >= 0, "Input must be non-negative")
@ensures(result > 0, "Result is always positive")
@complexity(time: O(n), space: O(1))
@pure
func factorial(n: Int) -> Int {
    var result: Int = 1
    
    @invariant(result > 0, "Result remains positive throughout calculation")
    for i in range(1, n+1) {
        result *= i
    }
    
    @verify { 
        assert factorial(0) == 1
        assert factorial(5) == 120
    }
    
    return result
}
```

### ✅ **Built-in Test Execution**

Every function **must** have an associated test. The compiler (`gibbc`) runs tests **before** compiling:

```gibber
@pure
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

@test
def test_add() -> void:
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
```

🚨 **No tests? No compile!**

### ✅ **Strong Typing + Type Inference**

```gibber
let x = 42          # Inferred as int
let name = "Gibber" # Inferred as string
let nums = [1, 2, 3] # Inferred as List<int>
```

### ✅ **Generics & Collections**

```gibber
class Stack<T>:
    let items: List<T> = []

    def push(item: T) -> void:
        items.append(item)

    def pop() -> T:
        return items.remove_last()
```
