# Gibber: An AI-Optimized Programming Language


## 🚀 Introduction

Gibber is a new programming language designed **specifically for AI-assisted coding**. Unlike traditional languages optimized for human developers, Gibber is built to enhance **Large Language Model (LLM) code generation**—making it more **accurate, efficient, and bug-free**. It addresses the unique capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models when generating, understanding, and modifying code.

## Core Philosophy

Gibber is built on three foundational principles:

1. **Explicit Intent** - The language prioritizes clear expression of programmer intent over implementation details.
2. **Contextual Clarity** - Code structure helps LLMs maintain context and track relationships between components.
3. **Predictable Patterns** - Consistent, regular syntax patterns make it easier for both AI and humans to predict and understand code behavior.

### Why Gibber?

LLMs like Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude and others generate code in existing languages but often:

- Produce **suboptimal** or **redundant** code.
- Struggle with **implicit logic and ambiguous syntax**.
- Require **manual debugging and testing**.

Gibber solves this by providing:

- **LLM-Friendly Syntax**: Highly structured, predictable, and constrained.
- **Enforced Testing**: Code must include tests, which are executed at compile time.
- **Strong Typing + Type Inference**: Reduces ambiguity while keeping code concise.
- **Generics & Collections**: Built-in support for common data structures.
- **Multi-Platform Compilation**: Like Rust, write once and compile anywhere.

## Key Innovations

Gibber introduces several novel language features:

- **Purpose Declarations** - Code blocks include explicit declarations of their purpose and invariants.
- **Pattern Templates** - Common algorithmic patterns are first-class language constructs.
- **Context Tracking** - Explicit scope boundaries and relationship markers help maintain context.
- **Effect Isolation** - Side effects are tracked and controlled through the type system.
- **Verification Hooks** - Built-in hooks for runtime verification of expected behaviors.

## Example: A Simple Function

```gibber
@purpose("Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer")
@requires(n >= 0, "Input must be non-negative")
@ensures(result > 0, "Result is always positive")
@complexity(time: O(n), space: O(1))
@pure
func factorial(n: Int) -> Int {
    var result: Int = 1
    
    @invariant(result > 0, "Result remains positive throughout calculation")
    for i in range(1, n+1) {
        result *= i
    }
    
    @verify { 
        assert factorial(0) == 1
        assert factorial(5) == 120
    }
    
    return result
}
```
